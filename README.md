## Description
**Employee Attendance Tracker** is a Django-based web app designed to allow multiple facilities to track and manage employee attendance and compliance. 

Each facility is assigned a General Manager (GM), who can:
- Add managers and employees
- Record daily attendance and compliance data
- Generate printable reports

The architecture supports scalable roles and permissions. A District Manager (DM) feature is planned for assigning and managing GMs across multiple locations.
