## Description
This project will allow multiple people from multiple facilities track employee attendance in each individual facility.  The design will allow for GMs to create managers for that facility and to manage employees.  All levels have the ability to enter daily compliance, GMs can modify any prior day compliance. Reports are available for all.  A DM feature is planned to allow DMs to create GMs and assign them to any facility the DM has assigned to them.
